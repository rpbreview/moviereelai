## How Does MovieReelAI Work?

So, how does this thing actually turn your ideas into videos? It’s surprisingly simple, broken down into four steps anyone can follow:

**Step 1 – Enter Your Script or Story**

Paste your text into the platform—could be a full script, a quick story, or just a concept. The AI reads it, understands the flow, and builds detailed scenes for you. No need to map it out yourself.

**Step 2 – Choose Your Style**

Pick from a huge library of styles—think Cinematic, Anime, Comic Book, or even Cyberpunk. One click sets the look for your whole project, keeping it consistent and polished.

**Step 3 – Customize Your Scenes**

Here’s where you get hands-on. Adjust characters, tweak lighting, shift camera angles—all with easy point-and-click controls. It’s intuitive, not intimidating.

**Step 4 – Export & Profit**

When you’re happy, export your video in formats ready for any platform—YouTube, Instagram, you name it. Share it, sell it, or use it to grow your brand.
